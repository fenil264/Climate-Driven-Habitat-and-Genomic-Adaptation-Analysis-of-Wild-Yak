# Climate-Driven Habitat and Genomic Adaptation Analysis of Wild Yak

## Overview

This project explores how climate change impacts the habitat suitability and genomic adaptation of wild yak populations. Advanced machine learning models, feature engineering, and ensemble techniques are used to predict future habitats and analyze adaptive genomic patterns. The analysis delivers actionable metrics for conservation planning under SSP245 and SSP585 climate scenarios projected to 2050.



## Key Highlights

- **Exceptional Model Performance:** Achieved a 99.9% AUC score for predicting habitat suitability.
- **Scenario-Based Analysis:** Evaluated habitat shifts under SSP245 and SSP585 climate projections for 2050.
- **Genomic Insight:** Identified key patterns and signals of adaptation to changing environments.
- **Conservation-Focused:** Provides future habitat predictions to inform conservation policy and resource allocation.

## Project Metrics

| Metric                         | Value            |
|------------------------------- |------------------|
| **AUC Score**                  | 0.999            |
| **Climate Scenarios**          | SSP245, SSP585   |
| **Projection Horizon**         | 2050             |

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Climate Data Processing
- Genomic Data Analysis
- Geographical Information Systems (GIS)

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Curates climate predictors, spatial layers, and wild yak genomic data.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracts and transforms environmental and genetic features relevant to adaptation.
3. **Model Training:** Trains advanced ensemble machine learning models (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) for habitat prediction.
4. **Evaluation:** Achieves a near-perfect AUC, validating the predictive accuracy on withheld test sets.
5. **Scenario Simulation:** Projects potential changes in habitat suitability under future climate scenarios.
6. **Genomic Association:** Links genomic markers to environmental gradients, highlighting adaptation patterns.

## Applications
